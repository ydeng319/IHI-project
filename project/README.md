### Architecture Diagram
The architecture diagram of this project is shown in Figure 1. The breakdown of the components and their relationships include:

User: Represents the end user who interacts with the system to visualize the bird flu spread trend
Web App: A web application that serves as the interface for the user. It's where the user views and interacts with the data visualizations. The web app is built using streamlit.
Cloud Server: Hosts the web application and manages the data flow between the web app and the GitHub repository.
GitHub Repo: Stores the application's code and possibly the bird flu data or scripts to fetch the data. It acts as a version control system and can also be part of the deployment pipeline.
Data Visualization: A python script for the date preprocessing and visualization pipeline, along with a web app, built using Streamlit, dedicated to visualizing the bird flu data effectively.
Bird Flu Data: The dataset that is used by the Streamlit component to create visualizations. It‚Äôs stored in a database or a similar data storage solution (e.g. csv file) accessible by the web app.
For an user accesses the web app hosted on a cloud server, which retrieves data visualizations powered by Streamlit from the bird flu data, and all updates or application code are managed through a GitHub repository.
